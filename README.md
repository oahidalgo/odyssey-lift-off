# Odyssey Lift-off

Welcome to the companion app of Odyssey Lift-off! This repository serves as the starting point for your journey in learning GraphQL and React.

## How to use this repo

The repository consists of three main folders:

- `server`: Contains the initial setup for the GraphQL server.
- `client`: Contains the initial setup for the React application.
- `final`: Contains the final stage of both the server and client folders, with all the steps and code completed.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the GraphQL API server.

In another terminal window, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the React application.

This will open `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
